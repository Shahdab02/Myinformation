                <h1>My Journey: From a Small Village to Engineering College</h1>

                <p>Life is full of challenges, but with determination and hard work, anything is possible. My journey—from studying in a government school to pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering—has been a rollercoaster of struggles, sacrifices, and achievements.</p>
                
                <h2>Early Education: A Strong Foundation</h2>
                
                I studied in a government school from Class 1 to Class 10. I was always good at studies, and Mathematics was my favorite subject. My elder brother and I studied together from Class 5 to 10, and despite financial difficulties, we never gave up on education.
                
                To support our family, my brother worked at our mama’s shop, Nazir Fruit Shop at Urwan More. This helped us continue our education without much difficulty.
                
                In 2019, both of us appeared for the 10th board exams from Government High School, Urwan Chandwara, Koderma. I secured 79% marks, which was a proud moment for me. However, due to financial constraints, my brother had to drop out and started working to support the family.
                
                <h2>The ITI Phase: A Step Towards Career</h2>
                
                After Class 10, I appeared for the ITI entrance exam and secured a good rank, which got me admission to Government ITI, Barhi, Hazaribagh, in the Electrician trade. Meanwhile, my brother moved to Delhi for work, and I started working at Nazir Fruit Shop to support my education.
                
                Unfortunately, the lockdown disrupted everything. I was unable to study properly, but after it was lifted, I completed my first year successfully. However, in the second year, I was initially marked fail in one subject. I applied for rechecking, and when the results came, I had actually passed with 90% marks, securing 4th rank in my college.
                
                <h2>Choosing Science and Moving Forward</h2>
                
                After ITI, I decided to complete my 12th with Science. I took admission in +2 High School, Barhi, Hazaribagh, and joined Vectors Classes, Barhi for coaching. However, balancing work at the shop and studies became a challenge. Despite all difficulties, I managed to complete my 12th with 68% marks.
                
                <h2>The Dream of Engineering</h2>
                
                After 12th, I made the biggest decision of my life—I decided to pursue Engineering. I got admission to Jaipur Engineering College, Kukas, Jaipur, in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) branch. This was a dream come true, and I was excited to explore the world of technology.
                
                <h2>Lessons and Looking Ahead</h2>
                
                My journey has been full of struggles, from financial difficulties to balancing work and studies. But every challenge made me stronger. I have learned that hard work, consistency, and never giving up are the keys to success.
                
                Today, as I study B.Tech in CSE, I look forward to building a bright future. My goal is to use my skills to create something meaningful, help my family, and make my journey an inspiration for others.
                
                No matter how tough life gets, if you have the willpower, nothing can stop you from achieving your dreams.
